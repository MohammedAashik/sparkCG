Communication:
----------------

Definition of communication: It is a process of influencing someone or others to achieve objective or objectives.

This means that every form of communication has 2 main parts- there is always an objective(goal/ purpose/ reason) and it includes influence(of some kind).


1) The forming of opinion without real experience and which is based on opiniouns of others is called prejudice.

Rate of speech: total no of words you speak in 1 minute
Fluency: the ease with which you speak english
Diction: is the choice of words used
prejudice: forming an opinion about other person
Thought process: the ability to think logically
Emotional intelligence: understanding self and others in a good way


External customers:

Paraphrasing: When you rephrase an information in your own words it is called Paraphrasing.
Verbal nods: short words of acknowledgement 
profanity: vulgar or abusive language

1) Prejudice is barrier to communication
2) Criticizing your manager in front of others is inappropriate behaviour in workplace
